### Instructions.
This is our location for the GA-CDRC Data Group Stata training.  
You will find all datasets for this training programme in the dataset repository `data_statatraining`  
  
*EACH WEEK* you should read the Stata Training Instructions for that week. Each week has its own page in this wiki - look to the sidebar for these instructions. The instructions will give you the name and location of the required dataset(s), and the Stata problem to solve. You will need to build one or more Stata `.do` files that accomplish the tasks set out in the instructions. We will give ourselves 1 week for each set of instructions. 
  
The topics for each week are available at the DataGroup intranet site under [`in-house Stata training`](https://theuwi.sharepoint.com/sites/DataGroup/Lists/Inhouse%20Stata%20training/AllItems.aspx).  They are also listed in the Table below.

The training has no specific end-date - we will keep on rolling for as long as we can think of interesting problems to solve. Training weeks are numbered from 1 upwards.

You can review the specific training topics [in this wiki](https://github.com/UWI-DataGroup/repo_statatraining/wiki/Training-Topics).
